\usage{
getStations(latlong = NA, zip = NA, state = NA, country = NA,
  city = NA, radius = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{latlong}{A numeric vector specifying latitude and longitude.}

\item{zip}{Character string representing a US zip code.}

\item{state}{US two character state code, a city may also be supplied. If no city is supplied, all cities returned for that state will be queried (may take a lot of time).}

\item{country}{Name of a (non-US) country. If no city is supplied, all cities returned for that country will be queried (may take a lot of time).}

\item{city}{Name of the requested city.}

\item{radius}{Optional radius in miles to limit results to. Must be a numeric value greater than 0 but less than 25. If querying by state or country, the behavior here may not be intuitive.}
}
\value{
A PWStations object with the nearby stations meeting the specified criteria.
}
\description{
Queries the WUnderground API to get all PWS meeting the specified criteria. Valid queries are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item A numeric vector specifying a lat/long pair.
  \item A US zipcode character string.
  \item A US state or non-US country name.
  \item A US state and city pair.
  \item A non-US country name and city pair.
}
The API limits to PWS within 40km (around 25 miles) of the zipcode and only the first 50 results.
An optional numeric mile radius restriction may be supplied, limiting to stations within that distance from
the specified location. Anything greater than 24 will be ignored (due to the API limitation).

latLongStations <- getStations(latlong = c(35.229, -80.8433), radius = 2) # Charlotte
zipStations <- getStations(zip = "90210", radius = 10)
berlinStations <- getStations(country = "Germany", city = "Berlin")
cityStations <- getStations(state = "Oregon", city = "Portand", radius = 3)
countryStations <- getStations(country = "Spain")
